Here is the reconciliation result:

```json
{
  "matched_items": [
    {
      "invoice_description": "GPO Single Power Outlet",
      "docket_description": "Power Outlet - GPO",
      "quantity": 15
    },
    {
      "invoice_description": "CAT6 Data Cable (10m)",
      "docket_description": "CAT6 Cable - 10m",
      "quantity": 7
    },
    {
      "invoice_description": "2-Gang Switch Plate",
      "docket_description": "Switch Plate - 2 Gang",
      "quantity": 4
    }
  ],
  "discrepancies": [],
  "summary": "3 matched, 0 missing, 0 extra"
}
```

Explanation:
- All items in the invoice match with the delivery docket, both in description and quantity. The descriptions are slightly different, but they refer to the same items.
- There are no discrepancies found, hence the "discrepancies" array is empty.
- The summary indicates that all 3 items matched and there are no missing or extra items.
